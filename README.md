# personality-ml
cis 545 final project

In this notebook, we use data collected from Cattell's 16 Personality Factors Test to explore whether trends exist between how people answer personality questions and characteristics such as gender, age, and where they are from. 
We use linear and logistic regression as well as random forest to build our machine learning models.
